At the beginning of 2022, I took a leap of faith and enrolled in the <span style={{color: "white"}}>DevMountain</span> coding boot camp. Falling in love 
with <span style={{color: "white"}}>web development</span> , during the program I gained expertise in both <span style={{color: "white"}}>front-end</span>  and <span style={{color: "white"}}>back-end</span> development.
<br />
With a successful internship <span style={{color: "white"}}>at Clingstone</span>, I honed my skills in <span style={{color: "white"}}>Agile development</span>  and collaborating with 
clients. My main focus these days is building captivating products of the web - with clean and maintainable
code, leaving a remarkable impact in the digital world.
<br />
Passionate  about mentoring others, I inspire aspiring coders
to follow their dreams and embrace the ever-evolving world of web development .
